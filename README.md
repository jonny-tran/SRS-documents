## 📖 About This Repository

Welcome to my documentation archive. This repository serves as a portfolio and knowledge base where I store technical documents for various software projects I have analyzed, designed, and developed.

**The goal of this repository is to:**
* Practice and demonstrate **Business Analysis (BA)** and **System Architecture** skills.
* Archive standardized documents (SRS, SDD, API Specs) following industry standards (IEEE 830, etc.).
* Share knowledge and references with the developer community.
